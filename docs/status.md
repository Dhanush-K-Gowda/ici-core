Update Type: Project Structure
Summary: Updated project issues to align with Intelligent Consciousness Interface (ICI) architecture
Details: |
  Completely revised the project-issues.md file to replace Telegram-specific functionality 
  with the ICI architecture components. Key changes include:
  
  - Restructured all milestones to align with the ICI's dual-pipeline architecture
  - Created dedicated milestones for Ingestion Pipeline, Query Pipeline, and Shared Components
  - Replaced Telegram-specific issues (MTProto, Message Handling) with ICI components
    (Ingestor, Preprocessor, Embedder, etc.)
  - Added new issues for YAML configuration system and pipeline integration
  - Updated all prerequisites and acceptance criteria to reflect the new architecture
  - Each issue still maintains the same structure with status flags, logs of completed work,
    and tasks to be done
  
  The updated project issues now provide a clear roadmap for implementing the ICI 
  framework as defined in the functional requirements and technical specifications.
Components Affected:
  - docs/project-issues.md
Current Status: In Progress
Blockers: None
Next Steps:
  - Begin implementation of Issue 1.0 (Codebase Directory Structure Documentation)
  - Set up project environment as per Issue 1.1
  - Implement core database structure for ingestor state tracking
Additional Notes: |
  The revised issues include 6 milestones and ~15 issues, providing a comprehensive
  implementation plan for the ICI framework. Each component in both pipelines has
  its own dedicated issue with clear acceptance criteria.
