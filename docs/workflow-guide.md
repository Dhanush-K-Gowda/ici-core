# Issue Development Workflow Guide

This document defines the standardized workflow for tackling issues in the Telegram AI Personal Assistant project. It outlines the process from issue selection to completion, including testing and documentation requirements.

## Issue Lifecycle States

Issues in this project follow a defined lifecycle with these states:

1. **NOT_STARTED**: Initial state for all issues.
2. **IN_PROGRESS**: Work is actively being done on the issue.
3. **TESTING**: Implementation is complete and undergoing testing.
4. **BLOCKED**: Issue cannot proceed due to dependencies or other blockers.
5. **COMPLETED**: Issue has passed all tests and met all acceptance criteria.

## Standard Issue Workflow

### 1. Issue Selection and Planning

#### Actions:
- Review issue description, acceptance criteria, and prerequisites
- Verify all prerequisites are completed
- Create a detailed implementation plan
- Break down the implementation into smaller tasks
- Identify potential challenges and risks
- Estimate time and resources required

#### Best Practices:
- Select issues based on project priorities and dependencies
- Ensure understanding of the issue's purpose and context
- Consult relevant documentation and existing code
- Document any questions or clarifications needed
- Allocate sufficient time for unexpected challenges

#### Deliverables:
- Implementation plan with task breakdown
- Time and resource estimates
- List of potential risks and mitigation strategies

### 2. Development Environment Setup

#### Actions:
- Ensure development environment is properly configured
- Create a feature branch for the issue (naming: `feature/issue-[number]-[short-description]`)
- Update issue status to IN_PROGRESS
- Update status.md with current progress

#### Best Practices:
- Always work in a dedicated branch
- Pull latest changes from main branch before starting
- Verify environment matches project requirements
- Document any environment-specific configurations

#### Deliverables:
- Feature branch created
- Updated issue status
- Status update in status.md

### 3. Test-Driven Development

#### Actions:
- Write tests based on acceptance criteria before implementation
- Define test cases covering functionality, edge cases, and error handling
- Implement test fixtures and mocks as needed
- Verify tests fail correctly before implementation

#### Best Practices:
- Cover all acceptance criteria with tests
- Include both happy path and error cases
- Use descriptive test names following convention: `test_should_[expected_behavior]_when_[condition]`
- Keep tests independent and isolated
- Use appropriate mocks for external dependencies

#### Deliverables:
- Test suite covering all acceptance criteria
- Test documentation
- Initial failing tests

### 4. Implementation

#### Actions:
- Implement the solution in small, testable increments
- Run tests frequently to verify progress
- Document code following project standards
- Refactor as needed for clarity and maintainability
- Update "Logs of what is done till now" section

#### Best Practices:
- Follow project coding standards and patterns
- Keep commits small and focused
- Write clear commit messages
- Document complex logic with comments
- Regularly push changes to remote repository
- Periodically update the issue with progress

#### Deliverables:
- Implemented solution meeting acceptance criteria
- Well-documented code
- Passing unit tests
- Updated issue with progress logs

### 5. Testing Phase

#### Actions:
- Complete implementation of all requirements
- Update issue status to TESTING
- Run comprehensive test suite
- Perform manual testing as needed
- Fix any issues discovered during testing
- Document test results

#### Best Practices:
- Test across different environments if applicable
- Verify edge cases and error handling
- Measure performance against requirements
- Have another team member review/test if possible
- Update tests if requirements change

#### Deliverables:
- Passing test suite
- Test coverage report
- Documentation of test results
- Updated issue status

### 6. Documentation and Finalization

#### Actions:
- Update project documentation if needed
- Complete "What needs to be done more" section
- Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
- Prepare pull request
- Update status.md with completion details

#### Best Practices:
- Be thorough in documenting any API changes
- Include usage examples where appropriate
- Cross-reference related documentation
- Ensure documentation is clear and concise
- List any future improvements in "What needs to be done more"

#### Deliverables:
- Updated documentation
- Completed issue notes
- Pull request

### 7. Review and Completion

#### Actions:
- Address any feedback from code review
- Make necessary adjustments
- Update issue status to COMPLETED when approved
- Merge pull request to main branch
- Update status.md with completion

#### Best Practices:
- Be responsive to review feedback
- Verify changes don't introduce regressions
- Ensure all discussions are resolved before final approval
- Document any significant changes made during review

#### Deliverables:
- Reviewed and approved code
- Merged changes
- Updated issue status to COMPLETED
- Final status update in status.md

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing
- Each functional component must have unit tests
- Tests should cover all public methods and functions
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Aim for >80% code coverage for critical components

### Integration Testing
- Test interactions between components
- Verify correct data flow between modules
- Test with realistic data scenarios
- Include error handling and recovery tests

### End-to-End Testing
- Test complete user workflows
- Verify system behavior from user perspective
- Include performance testing where specified in requirements
- Test all supported platforms and environments

### Test Documentation
- Document test approach for complex features
- Include test data generation methods
- Document any manual testing procedures
- Note any limitations or assumptions in testing

## Progress Tracking

### Status Updates
- Update issue status when state changes
- Document progress in "Logs of what is done till now"
- Update "What needs to be done more" as work progresses
- Add detailed notes for any encountered challenges

### Blockers
- Immediately update issue status to BLOCKED when blockers are encountered
- Document the nature of the blocker
- Identify potential workarounds or alternatives
- Estimate impact on timeline
- Update status when blocker is resolved

### Completion Criteria
An issue is considered COMPLETED when:
- All acceptance criteria are fully met
- All tests pass successfully
- Code has been reviewed and approved
- Documentation is updated
- Changes are merged to the main branch

## Logging Guidelines

### Logs of What Is Done Till Now
Entries should include:
- Date of work
- Specific tasks completed
- Progress toward acceptance criteria
- Challenges encountered and solutions
- Current status of implementation
- Tests implemented and their status

### What Needs to Be Done More
Entries should include:
- Remaining tasks to complete the issue
- Known issues or limitations to address
- Optimizations or refactorings needed
- Documentation requirements
- Testing gaps to fill
- Any follow-up work identified during implementation
